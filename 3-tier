# 3-Tier  Network Simulation

## Project Overview
This project simulates a **3-tier enetwork** using Cisco Packet Tracer.  
It demonstrates the design and implementation of a scalable and secure  network, including **Access, Distribution, and Core layers**, VLAN segmentation, inter-VLAN routing, 
---

## Network Topology
- **Core Layer:**
  - Layer 3 switches responsible for routing between Distribution layers and external networks.
  - Provides **high-speed backbone** connectivity and redundancy.

- **Distribution Layer:**
  - Aggregates VLANs from Access Layer.
  - Implements **inter-VLAN routing** and redundancy protocols (HSRP).

- **Access Layer:**
  - Connects end devices such as PCs, servers, and IoT devices.
  - Segments traffic into **VLANs** for different departments or services.

- **ASA Firewall:**
  - Provides NAT and ACL security between internal networks, DMZ, and outside networks.

- **DMZ Webserver:**
  - Hosts web services accessible to Inside networks and simulated external networks.
  - Isolated from internal LAN for security.

## Key Configurations
### VLANs & Routing
- Created multiple VLANs for internal segmentation (e.g., VLAN10, VLAN20, VLAN30, VLAN40).
- Inter-VLAN routing configured on Distribution/Core switches.
- HSRP implemented for **redundancy and high availability**.



## Testing & Results
- **Inside VLAN → Inside VLAN:** Allowed according to routing and ACLs.
- **Inside VLAN → DMZ:** Ping and HTTP/HTTPS tests successful.
- **Inside VLAN → Internet:** NAT allows external connectivity (simulated in Packet Tracer).
- **Outside → Lan: 172.16.1.0/24 ( services)
